# NTT Data Side Project - MasterZ

Sample project focused on Ethereum and Solidity language, following ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards for nft management.

## Description

Create at least 1 NFT smart contract with ERC-721 standard in the Ethereum testnet, representing a land to which it is connected at least a smart contract NFT with standard ERC-721 that represents an asset located above the ground (e.g. house, river, building, mine, plantation, etc.)
Then sell and purchase such NFT, both individually and as a whole package to a third-party user and do the same with the NFT ERC-1155 standard.

## Next steps

- [ ] Finish implementing erc-1155 (wip)
- [ ] Proxy pattern implementation
